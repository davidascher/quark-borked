Piece of Cake by Camilla V. Saulsbury (Robert Rose, $29.94) is for bakers who don't want complicated multi-step recipes but still want to avoid the cake-mix route. All the recipes are one-bowl wonders with no creaming, no egg separating, no sifting or need for a heavy-duty mixer. I mixed the caramel apple cake recipe here in less than 10 minutes once I'd gotten the apples peeled.

Saulsbury says of the cake: "I like putting an adult spin on some of my favourite childhood treats -- for example, caramel apples, which I've refashioned into irresistible sheet cake. A homemade caramel icing is spread over the top, balancing the tart-sweetness of Granny Smith apples for a perfect harmony of cake, caramel and fruit."

Store the cake, loosely wrapped in foil or wax paper, in the refrigerator for up to three days. The cooled, uniced cake can also be well-wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil, and frozen for up to six months. Let cake thaw at room temperature before icing.

### Caramel Apple Cake

* 2½ cups (625 mL) flour
* 1¾ cups (430 mL) sugar
* 2 teaspoons (10 mL) baking powder
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) salt
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) ground cinnamon
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 cup (250 mL) vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla extract
* 3 cups (750 mL) hopped peeled Granny Smith or other tart cooking apples
* 1 cup (250 mL) chopped toasted pecans

### Steps

* In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.
* Add the eggs, oil and vanilla and stir with a wooden spoon until blended. Gently stir in apples and pecans.
