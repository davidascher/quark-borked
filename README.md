learning about stuff.

Status: 

Dones:
 x renamed pages register redirects serverside [this feel great as a user]
 x click away from textbox should escape / save it
 x persist reorderings through index tweakings

Todos:
 - figure out how to indent para while keeping paragraph reordering reliably smooth.
 - think about UX for new para and new page link
 - redirects get scanned periodically to fix links from internal pages
 - show redirects?
 - (someday: redirects get broadcast to peers)
