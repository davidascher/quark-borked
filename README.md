learning about stuff.

Status: 

Dones:
 x renamed pages register redirects serverside [this feel great as a user]
 x click away from textbox should escape / save it

Todos:
 - persist reorderings through index tweakings
 - think about UX for new para and new page link
 - think about new foreign link
 - redirects get scanned periodically to fix links from internal pages
 - (someday: redirects get broadcast to peers)
