Dones:
 x renamed pages register redirects serverside [this feel great as a user]
 x click away from textbox should escape / save it
 x persist reorderings through index tweakings

Todos:
 - think about urls, routing, etc.
 - import a real corpus (my recipes?)
 - think about search interactions, curating search results
 - make personal:
 	- when not logged in, can't edit?
 	- or make not-logged-in-edits suggestions for curation?
 	
 - figure out how to indent para while keeping paragraph reordering reliably smooth.
 - think about UX for new para and new page link
 - redirects get scanned periodically to fix links from internal pages
 - show redirects?
 - (someday: redirects get broadcast to peers)

Think about cards - current card, searched cards, past cards?
